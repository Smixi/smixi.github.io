## Introduction
Hello !

This website is used to document myself discovering or reimplementing different concepts or tools related to computer science or software development.
I am mainly using Python and Typescript in my everyday life, but I did some Java, C and even some VHDL back in the day. I may try to learn new languages by implementing basic concepts in other languages such as Go or Rust.
